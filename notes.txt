controllers (same as middleware functions) are the uniquw logic of routes 

====> ...middleares,(req, res, next) => {

    ...logic
    next() =====> this can be called or not in controllers
    res.send() ====> compulsory in middlewares

}, ...middlewares





middlewares are re-usable functions ====> (req, res, next) => {

    ...logic
    next() =====> this have to be called in middlewares
    res.send() ====> probably not compulsory
}
